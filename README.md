Right now getting a radio station is a huge burden bc broadcasting is tough to do locally,
and relying on something like iceCAST is necessary bc they have the server space. (they are the middle man)

but! we can use the distributed web to do some cool stuff, like creating a swarm of
people currently listening so they! can broadcast it for you. It is super simple.

thanks everyone
